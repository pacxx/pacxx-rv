Fork of The Region Vectorizer (LLVM 5.0 version)

Compiler Design Lab / Saarland University / Saarland Informatics Campus

The Region Vectorizer (RV) is a general-purpose vectorization framework for LLVM.
RV provides a unified interface to vectorize code regions, such as inner and outer loops, up to whole functions.
We had a poster on RV at the 2016 US LLVM Developers' Meeting (docs/poster_rv.pdf).
RV is largely based on the Whole-Function Vectorizer by Ralf Karrenberg (http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/wfv/).
